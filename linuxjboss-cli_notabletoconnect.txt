Issue

    Getting following error when trying to connect JBoss CLI over SSL in EAP 7 using command jboss-cli.bat --user="admin" --password="admin" --controller=localhost:<PORT> --connect
    Raw

    Failed to connect to the controller: The controller is not available at localhost:<PORT>: java.net.ConnectException: WFLYPRT0053: Could not connect to remote+http://localhost:<PORT>. The connection failed: WFLYPRT0053: Could not connect to remote+http://localhost:<PORT>. The connection failed: XNIO000812: Connection closed unexpectedly

    Getting following error when trying to connect JBoss CLI in EAP 7 using command jboss-cli.sh --controller=localhost:<PORT> --connect
    Raw

    Failed to connect to the controller: The controller is not available at localhost:<PORT>: java.net.ConnectException: WFLYPRT0053: Could not connect to remote+http://localhost:<PORT>. The connection failed: WFLYPRT0053: Could not connect to remote+http://localhost:<PORT>. The connection failed: Connection refused

Resolution

    Use command "jboss-cli.bat --user="admin" --password="admin" --controller=remote+https://localhost:<PORT> --connect" to connect.

    Or to make "remote+https" the default protocol, add line <default-protocol use-legacy-override="true">remote+https</default-protocol>" in used jboss-cli.xml as follows:
    Raw

    <jboss-cli xmlns="urn:jboss:cli:3.1">
        <default-protocol use-legacy-override="true">remote+https</default-protocol>
        <!-- The default controller to connect to when 'connect' command is executed w/o arguments -->
        <default-controller>
            <protocol>remote+https</protocol>
            <host>localhost</host>
            <port>PORT</port>
        </default-controller>

    If you are facing a second issue with jboss-cli.sh then Remove or comment out the "remote+https" the default protocol in used jboss-cli.xml as follows:
    Raw

    <!--  Example controller alias named 'Test'  
        <controllers>
            <controller name="Test">
                <host>localhost</host>
                <port>PORT</port>
            </controller>
        </controllers>
        -->  

Root Cause

    The default protocol remote+http is missing from jboss-cli.

    The duplicate protocol is configured with alias is as given.
    Raw

     <controllers>
            <controller name="Test">
                <protocol>remote+http</protocol>
                <host>localhost</host>
                <port>PORT</port>
            </controller>
        </controllers>
